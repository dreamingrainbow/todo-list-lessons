# todo-list-lessons
This is a compilation of sub repositories leading in a progression of To-do-List Applications. 

These repositories utilizing 
  1) NodeJs
  2) React
  2) Redux
  4) Axios
  5) Express
  6) Bootstrap
  7) JQuery
  
and other modules as needed to create the progression of To-do List Applications.

In this progression of applications we will take you from a simple express server todo-list application, to a class driven express application, then we can take you from express to a react state driven to-do list application, through redux, and then into using the express todo-list application.

To get started we need to make sure our systems are setup. I recommend utilizing what ever environment your feel comfortable in. I will use VSCode through out as my IDE, and will use a Power Shell Command Prompt. I am using Windows 10, with GitBash mapped to my path environment variables. 

The follow repositiories are a suggested order but by no means are required.

## Server Side Todo List

This is a simple todo list api server application example. Using the GET,POST,PUT, DELETE we create our basic routes and handle the todo list.


## Server Side Todo List -- With Class <-- ;)

This is the same Server side todo list accept here we have turned our todo list into a class with methods.

## Client Side State Driven Todo List

In our state driven client side todo list we handle all our methods in our react app component.

## Client Side With Redux

In this lesson we learn how to take our initial client side todo list and bring in redux.


## Client Side With Redux, and Axios and Using Our Server Side Application
